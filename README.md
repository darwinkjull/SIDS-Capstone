# SafeSleep 

A Carleton Engineering fourth year capstone project centered around the implementation of best practices for SIDS.


## About the project:
This project is a capstone done as part of our undergraduate Biomedical and Electrical Engineering degrees at Carleton University. A capstone project typically requires students to apply the engineering knowledge they have developed to a real engineering project. We have chosen to develop a mobile application that will support new parents in implementing evidence-based best practices for Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS). 

This project is conducted under the supervision of Fateme Rajabiyazdi, an assosciate professor in the Faculty of Engineering and Design at Carleton University.
